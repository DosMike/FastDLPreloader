# FastDL Preloader

**Warning: The total contents of our fastDL is over 80 GB, make sure you have space!**

This script will pull the whole content form the fastDL to disk. You need python3 for this!

To run the script, open the directory the script is in with a CMD and use the following commands:

* `python3 --directory fastdl`  -  this will run in a mode that allows continuation if you cancel it with Ctrl+C
* `python3 --replace --directory fastdl`  -  replaces all files in the target directory

This is not any faster than downloading through the game, partially because the host is limiting
the download speed, so go watch some YouTube while this runs.

(I wanted to add a directory picker at some point, but got lazy, so no graphical user interface)
